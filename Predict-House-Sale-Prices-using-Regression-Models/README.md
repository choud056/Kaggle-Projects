# Predict-House-Sale-Prices-using-Regression-Models

This objective of this kaggle project is to design regression models to predict the price at which a house is going to be sold. 
Test and Train data sets were provided.

The first step was to preprocess the data, by filling in missing values and droping outliers and removing skewness from the data 

Next step was to design lasso and XGBoost regression models to fit the training data,
The parameters were decided using cross validation

Finally prediction of these two models were combined and the final prediction were saved as a output csv file.
